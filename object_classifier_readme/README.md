# What is Object Classifier?

## Analysis
Using disciplined measurement systems, object classification can break down frames of a video and pick out different key objects in everyframe to allow for object recognition and classification in an instant.

## Optimization
Just like any database, the more we use and enhance our Object Classifier application, the sharper it gets.

## Efficiency
Run on Cachengo hardware, Object Classifier is extremely time efficent, easy to use, and allows for more possibities achievable by our product.
