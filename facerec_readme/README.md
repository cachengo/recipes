## Security
Protect, control and lock important information with just a scan of your face that cannot be duplicated, where only authorized individuals can access the information intended for their eyes only.

## Optimization
Just like any database, the more we use and enhance our Facerec application, the sharper it gets.

## Efficiency
Run on Cachengo hardware, Facerec is extremely time efficent, easy to use, and still getting better every day.
